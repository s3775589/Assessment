# Abount My Interests in IT

-	My current interest in IT is programming and cyber security. This started from when I was younger as I would watch my brother play games often which led me to playing games and receiving my first computer from him. Once I had enough money, I build my first computer which began my interest in hardware and shortly after, I built computers for all my friends. 
-	I currently work as a Specalist Technician however, I would like to expand my career as I do not want to work in support forever. I did a lot of research in pathways and found that going to university was the best option for me. With this I decided on what interested me the most and found that RMIT had the most interesting course for me and offered online study which allows me to continue to work and gain more experience.
-	During this time, I would like to explore different aspects of IT where now I am most interested in programming and cyber security. However, my interests could change anytime. This does not bother me as the reason why I am studying this course is to see where my interests may lay.

At the moment the job I am most interested in is app/game developing. This could be anything from games to educational applications. I am interested in programming although I have almost no knowledge about it however, I am currently in the process of learning. 

The job listing above is looking for a Unity Developer who create web, video, holographic, virtual reality and branding.  They create 3D applications and augmented reality applications. You will need to have at least 3 years of experience with Unity3D and C# and have experience in cross platform development. You will need to have strong interest in the job and be able to communicate well in a team environment.

At the moment I do have any experience or knowledge when it comes to the recommendations listed above. I do have limited knowledge of what the Unity 3D engine is however I have not used it myself. I also have just started learning how to code and therefore have no real experience with programming. 

To obtain the skills and qualifications above, I believe the best pathway to getting there is by completing my university degree which will assist me in programming. Either during, or after completing the course, I would look for a job and work experience in the field to shadow someone who can teach me how things work in the industry and give pointers on how to refine my skills. I would also at the same time, complete an online course that would teach me how to develop my skills in Unity 3D which would also provide a certificate for proof upon completion. 
 

# Personal Test Results

## Results of the Tests

[Aptitude Test.pdf](https://github.com/s3775589/Assessment/files/2974871/Aptitude.Test.pdf)
[Learning Style Test.pdf](https://github.com/s3775589/Assessment/files/2974872/Learning.Style.Test.pdf)
[Myers-Brigg Test.pdf](https://github.com/s3775589/Assessment/files/2974873/Myers-Brigg.Test.pdf)

I completed three tests which were the Learning Style Test, the Myers-Brigg Test and the Aptitude Psychometric Test. All results for the above three tests are in the above links. The results give a little assistance to help you realise some things about yourself. This can be from suggestions on the best ways you can learn something, a bit about your personality and the aptitude test which helps you with how well you can come up with logical solutions.

Based on the results, when it comes to a team environment, I will need to be able to communicate with the team verbally as it will assist me in learning more effectively and will help me understand what the team has done and what the need from me. As an extraverted person, I am comfortable with speaking toward others which has a big impact on communication within a team. My core values are organisation, responsibility, efficiency and experience. This shows that I can do my part in the team and ensure that I provide help to others when they need it. I also take the initiative to help the team to ensure that the work gets completed in the best way possible.

When forming a team, I will need to consider people who have similar values as me when it comes to how they approach their work and how they work in a team as well. I must make sure that they I can reduce as many common issues that arise when you form a team.


# My Project

## Developing a game using Unity

### Overview

My project will be using Unity to develop an iOS 3D Role Playing Game.  The game will require you to complete several objectives such as defeating enemies and bosses to access higher and more difficult levels. The more you play the game, the more characters you can unlock with different achievements and you will also have the change to unlock hidden stages in the game. Each character will have different abilities unique to themselves and their properties. The goal of the game is to defeat the final boss by using skills that you develop as you play.

### Motivation

The reason why I decided to make a game such as this is because I have always been interested in fantasy games that I could enjoy. I have played many RPG games that are similar, and I wanted to make a game that is offline so that you can play anywhere and have a storyline that you would make people want to complete the game to find out how the story ends. Most of the time now, these games either have an uninteresting storyline, or requires an online connection. I want to make sure that people can play the game anywhere at any time.

### Descirption

To begin the game, you can choose amongst three characters. Each of these being a type of mage. Each mage will have different abilities from each other and follow a similar storyline where they have to defeat the black mage who had been terrorising the world. The characters will have to travel through the maps (and will unlock more maps as they progress) to defeat monsters and collect items for quests. 
You can also find loot and equipment from defeating monsters or purchasing them from the store. Each item will need you to be of the same level or higher as per the requirement before you can equip it. The items also have rarity with the highest being a legendary rarity which will have better stats and extra skill boosters. 
There will be a skill tree where you can choose which skills you put skill points into that will impact on the gameplay and playstyle of your choice (e.g. stronger damage, resistance, etc). It will feature an on-screen joystick to move your character around, item slots and skill slots. The screen itself will also have your health bar and special bar. You will have a chance to level your character up to level 50 and there will be an online PVP (Player vs Player) arena where you can fight with other people. 
As you level up your characters, you will unlock more skills from the skill tree which you can add points into. Each level you will obtain one skill point. You will also gain 3 character points per level which you can use to boost certain stats. The stats you can boost are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Essence and Intelligence. Each one will have certain benefits which you can use to increase your characters stats based on which one you chose. Some character stats will be more beneficial to certain classes than others.
The game will be open based RPG (Role Playing Game) which allows you to wander around maps. To complete the storyline, you will be required to complete a series of chain quests which helps provide you with money, experience and items. There are shops which you can sell and purchase items such as healing items and equipment. 
Once you reach the highest level. you are still able to wander around and complete dungeons which can help you find better equipment. It may also have more chances of finding rarer items and equipment. 

### Tools and Technology required

For a Unity based game all you will need to use is Unity 3D. This will allow you to write the programs for the game and help you develop it. You can also use it to do draw the game designs. Anything you will require to do with the game will be available on Unity 3D alone. For hardware, you will require a Windows machine to use the software. You will also need either an IOS emulator or an IOS device to test the game on. 

### Skills required

You will need to know how to use Unity itself to edit the gameplay with the editor that it and have a thorough understanding on how to use it/getting around it before you can create an RPG based IOS game. You need to know how to program as you will need to customise the gameplay and to alter minor issues which can only be done through programming. You will also need to have designing and animation skills to create appealing characters and skills with special effects.

### Outcome

If the game is successful in its creation then you will be able to roll out the game for other people to download and play. As it is a game, and an open world game, there will be many bugs and issues that come with it. As this is always an issue, you will need to be able to be ready to alter the game so that the bugs no longer impact the gameplay. There is no way to avoid all bugs in the game and can only be fixed and altered once they appear. The best way to do this is to have beta testers who can play the game and create reports on when there are bugs present. Overall, the game itself will be able to provide entertainment to those interested in a fantasy role playing game.
