## Abount My Interests in IT

-	My current interest in IT is programming and cyber security. This started from when I was younger as I would watch my brother play games often which led me to playing games and receiving my first computer from him. Once I had enough money, I build my first computer which began my interest in hardware and shortly after, I built computers for all my friends. 
-	I currently work as a Specalist Technician however, I would like to expand my career as I do not want to work in support forever. I did a lot of research in pathways and found that going to university was the best option for me. With this I decided on what interested me the most and found that RMIT had the most interesting course for me and offered online study which allows me to continue to work and gain more experience.
-	During this time, I would like to explore different aspects of IT where now I am most interested in programming and cyber security. However, my interests could change anytime. This does not bother me as the reason why I am studying this course is to see where my interests may lay.

At the moment the job I am most interested in is app/game developing. This could be anything from games to educational applications. I am interested in programming although I have almost no knowledge about it however, I am currently in the process of learning. 

The job listing above is looking for a Junior Programmer who specialises in Game Developing.  The role requires you to work for a gaming company to develop games for iOS, Android, Oculus (VR), Vive (VR) and more. 

The position required you to have a passion for gaming and at least 2 years experience. The company uses Unity 3D to program their games so it is a requirement that you are highly proficient when it comes to using Unity 3D.  It is recommended that you should have programming experience with C++, Objective C and Javascript. Animation experience is desired as you will work with a number of animation programs such as 3DS Max and others. 

At the moment I do have any experience or knowledge when it comes to the recommendations listed above. I do have limited knowledge of what the Unity 3D engine is however I have not used it myself. When it comes to programming, I do not have experience either. I do have some animation experience as I have previously used programs such as I have used Opentoonz before which I used to create a cartoon animation.
